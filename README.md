# To-Do-List
A to-do list website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows users to create, manage, and track tasks in a simple and interactive way.

HTML: Provides the structure of the page, including input fields for tasks, buttons to add or delete tasks, and a list to display tasks.
CSS: Styles the website, making it visually appealing with layouts, colors, and hover effects.
JavaScript: Adds interactivity, such as adding tasks dynamically, marking them as completed, editing tasks, or deleting them, and saving tasks in local storage for persistence.

This project is ideal for beginners to practice web development fundamentals.
